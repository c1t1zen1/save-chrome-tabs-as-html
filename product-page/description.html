Name:
Save tabs to HTML file


Summary:
Save the title and URLs of open tabs as an HTML file.


Description:
This add-on saves all open tabs to an HTML file.

The file includes the title and URL of each tab, the browser user agent, and the date and time the file was saved. This can be useful as an ad-hoc way to save a browser session, since the URLs in the local file can be re-opened later as necessary.

Unlike similar addons that save to a text file, this extension saves the open tabs as HTML, which makes it easier to re-open the URLs from within the browser.

This addon does <em>not</em> store or archive the pages themselves. It only saves the URL and title of the page.

Incognito tabs are excluded.
