Name:
Save tabs to HTML file


Summary:
Save the title and URLs of open tabs as an HTML file.


Description:
This addon generates an HTML file containing links pointing to the tabs open in all windows.

The file includes the title and URL of each tab, the browser user agent, and the date and time the file was saved. This can be useful as an ad-hoc way to save a browser session.

Unlike similar addons that save to a text file, this extension saves the open tabs as HTML, which can be re-opened in the browser later and the URLs re-opened with a click.

This addon does <em>not</em> store or archive the pages themselves. It only saves the URL and title of the page.

Incognito tabs are excluded.
